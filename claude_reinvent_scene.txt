TASK:
Reinvent ONLY the target scene in a way that fits:
- overall story arc
- adjacent scenes (left and right)
- cast consistency and style_preset

CONSTRAINTS:
- Return JSON ONLY with this shape:
{
  "scene_patch": {
    "scene_id": "...",
    "visual_intent": "...",
    "camera_language": "...",
    "environment": "...",
    "symbolic_elements": ["..."],
    "prompt_base": "..."
  }
}
